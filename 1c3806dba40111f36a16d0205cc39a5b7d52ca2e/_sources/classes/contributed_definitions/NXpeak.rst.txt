======
NXpeak

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Description of peaks, their functional form or measured support.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_support**: Number of support points

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXcollection`

.. index:: NXcollection (base class); used in base class

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXpeak/label-field:

  .. index:: label (field)

  **label**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Human-readable identifier to specify which concept/entity
    the peak represents/identifies.

  .. _/NXpeak/peak_model-field:

  .. index:: peak_model (field)

  **peak_model**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Is the peak described analytically via a functional form
    or is it empirically defined via measured/reported
    intensity/counts as a function of an independent variable.

    If the functional form is not empirical or gaussian, users
    should enter other for the peak_model and add relevant details
    in the NXcollection.

    Any of these values: ``empirical`` | ``gaussian`` | ``lorentzian`` | ``other``

  .. _/NXpeak/position-field:

  .. index:: position (field)

  **position**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_support]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
    this array holds the position values for the independent variable.

  .. _/NXpeak/intensity-field:

  .. index:: intensity (field)

  **intensity**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_support]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
    this array holds the intensity/count values at each position.

  .. _/NXpeak/COLLECTION-group:

  **COLLECTION**: (optional) :ref:`NXcollection`

    In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this
    collection holds parameter of (and eventually) the functional form.
    For example in the case of Gaussians mu, sigma, cut-off values, 
    and background intensity are relevant parameter.
