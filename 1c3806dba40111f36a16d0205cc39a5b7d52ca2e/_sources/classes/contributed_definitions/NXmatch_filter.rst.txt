  .. index:: method (field)

    Meaning of the filter:
    Whitelist specifies which entries with said value to include.
    Entries with all other values will be filtered out.

    Blacklist specifies which entries with said value to exclude.
    Entries with all other values will be included.

    Any of these values: ``whitelist`` | ``blacklist``

  .. _/NXmatch_filter/match-field:

  .. index:: match (field)

  **match**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_values]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

    Array of values to filter according to method. For example if the filter
    specifies [1, 5, 6] and method is whitelist, only entries with values
    matching 1, 5 or 6 will be processed. All other entries will be filtered
    out.
