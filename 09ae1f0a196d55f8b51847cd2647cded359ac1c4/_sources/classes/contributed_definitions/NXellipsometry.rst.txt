  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`

    This is the application definition describing ellipsometry
    experiments.  Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a
    reflected beam of light with a single wavelength changes its
    polarization state, to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry
    experiment.  The application definition defines: - elements of the
    experimental instrument - calibration information if available -
    parameters used to tune the state of the sample - sample description

          performed, that is if Psi and delta are measured for your data, also
          provide Psi and delta here. And use the same wavelenghts as there.

            The wavelength or equivalent values (which are inter-convertible). The
            importer should convert all to one unit, and make the others
            accessible. Historically, energy is used in eV, but for visible
            spectroscopy wavelength is more common, for IR wave numbers in 1/cm
            units. Possibly use the same type of data as for the measurement!

      .. _/NXellipsometry/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/stage-group:

      **stage**: (recommended) :ref:`NXsubentry`

        Sample stage, holding the sample at a specific position in X,Y,Z
        (Cartesian) coordinate system and at an orientation defined by three
        Euler angles (alpha, beta, gamma). The stage may be motorized or
        manual, special for liquids or gas environment.

        **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (recommended) :ref:`NXtransformations`

          The stage coordinate system vs. the incident beam. The Z-axis of the
          stage is considered to point along the normal of the substrate (bottom
          reflecting surface) from the stage towards the general direction of
          the light source. The beam comes with angle of incidence towards this
          Z-axis, but in opposite direction, thus they are connected with a
          rotation of 180 - angle of incidence (in degrees). This transformation
          brings us from the NEXUS coordinates to the stage coordinates. Then
          provide the set of translations (if there are any). These all have a
          vector defining their relative direction in the current coordinate
          system. (This current coordinate system changes with every
          transformation if you set the parameter 'depends' to the name of the
          previous step.) Last, provide the rotations of the sample

            beam hits the sample and in what direction the sample stands in a
            free-text description, e.g. 'center of sample, long edge parallel to
            plane of incidence'.

      **window**: (optional) :ref:`NXaperture`

        For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor etc.)
        is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the direction of the
        source and the detector (looking from the sample). These windows also
        add a phase shift to the light altering the measured signal. This
        shift has to be corrected based on measuring a known sample in the
        environmental cell.
