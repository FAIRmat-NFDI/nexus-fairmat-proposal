**Structure**:

  .. _/NXapm/ENTRY-group:

  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition-field:

    .. index:: definition (field)

    **definition**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Official NeXus NXDL schema to which this entry conforms.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Version specifier which enables documentation of modifications to the
        schema.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_identifier-field:

    .. index:: experiment_identifier (field)

    **experiment_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Ideally, a (globally) persistent unique identifier for referring to
      this experiment. The identifier is usually defined/issued by the
      facility, laboratory, or the principle investigator. The identifier
      enables to link experiments to e.g. proposals.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_description-field:

    .. index:: experiment_description (field)

    **experiment_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Possibility for leaving a free-text description about the experiment.
      Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the
      respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
      of this application definition rather than writing these details in
      prose into this field here.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
      information included when the experiment started. If the application
      demands that time codes in this section of the application definition
      should only be used for specifying when the experiment was performed -
      and the exact duration of the experiment is not relevant - this start
      time field should be used. Often though it is useful to specify a time
      interval, i.e. start_time and end_time, to allow for more detailed
      bookkeeping and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be
      aware that even with having both time instances specified it may not
      be advisable to infer how long the experiment took or for how long
      data were acquired. More detailed timing data over the course of the
      experiment have to be collected for such a detailed bookkeeping.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601-formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC
      included when the experiment ended.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program-field:

    .. index:: program (field)

    **program**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program that was used to
      acquire/measure the dataset. Atom probe microscopy experiments are
      nowadays still in most cases controlled via commercial software. These
      are often designed as integrated acquisition and instrument control
      software. For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP)
      instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results and
      metadata are stored in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are
      proprietary. Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is
      connected to the control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary
      binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software
      other than of AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite). In effect, RHIT and HITS store
      the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless for
      users unless they have access to the commercial software. To arrive at
      a state that atom probe microscopy delivers a dataset with which one
      can study reconstructed atomic position and do e.g. composition
      analyses or other post-processing analysis tasks, these raw data have
      to be processed. Therefore, it is necessary that for an application
      definition to be useful, details about the physical acquisition of the
      raw data and all its processing steps have to be stored. With this a
      user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions (on the
      detector), calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived quantities
      are also need to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state ratios, and
      finally the tomographically reconstructed atomic positions. In many
      cases cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      via so-called ranging. Ranging defines a set of rules how one map
      between time-of-flight and mass-to-charge data on ion types, i.e.
      labels. In turn, these labels decode elemental identities and resolve
      isotopes. All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial
      software. Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also
      performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is
      strictly speaking not a single program used in atom probe not even for
      the early data acquisition and processing stages until one arrives at
      a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset. Therefore, the application
      definition documents not only the measurement but also these key post-
      processing steps.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally program version plus build number, or commit hash or
        description of ever persistent resources where the source code of the
        program and build instructions can be found so that the program can be
        configured ideally in such a manner that the result file is
        numerically recreatable in the same deterministic manner.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/run_number-field:

    .. index:: run_number (field)

    **run_number**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Not the specimen name or the experiment identifier but the identifier
      through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
      For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/AP Suite run
      number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
      Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments in Rouen, use the identifier
      that is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number. As a destructive
      microscopy method, a run can be performed only once. It is possible,
      however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition while still
      using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run needs to
      be distinguished with different run numbers. # This is how most atom
      probe groups handle it across the globe.

      datasets it is recommended to display the reconstruction as a 640x480
      pixel jpeg image. Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but
      not required as the main purpose of the thumbnail is to provide e.g.
      thumbnail images for displaying them in data repositories.

        the experiment was performed (e.g. technician operating the
        microscope, student, postdoc, principle investigator, guest ...).

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen-group:

    **specimen**: (required) :ref:`NXsample`

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Descriptive name or identifier with which to distinguish the specimen
        from all others and especially the parts from where it was cut. In
        cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from samples
        or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple specimens
        are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to resolve which
        specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken. The user is advised to
        store the details how specimens were cut/prepared from samples in the
        sample history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/sample_history-field:

      .. index:: sample_history (field)

      **sample_history**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally, a reference to the location of or a (globally persistent)
        unique identifier of e.g. another file which should document ideally
        as many details as possible of the material, its microstructure, and
        its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/preparation history. In the
        case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
        available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a sub-
        set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider being
        the key steps and relevant information about the specimen, its
        material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing state and
        details of the preparation.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/preparation_date-field:

        the specimen was prepared. Ideally report the end of the preparation,
        i.e. the last known time the measured specimen surface was actively
        prepared. Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific
        atmosphere is especially required for environmentally sensitive
        material such as hydrogen-charged specimens or experiments including
        tracers with a short half-time. The user is advised to include these
        temporal details in the sample_history.

        Use Hill's system for listing elements of the periodic table which are
        inside or attached to the surface of the specimen and thus considered
        relevant from a scientific point. The purpose of the field is to offer
        materials database systems an opportunity to parse the relevant
        elements without having to interpret these from the sample history.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (required) :ref:`NXdata`

      Hard link to a location/locations in the hierarchy of the NeXus file
      where the data for default plotting are stored.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe-group:

    **atom_probe**: (required) :ref:`NXinstrument`

      Metadata and numerical data of not only the microscope but also the
      lab in which this microscope is located. An atom probe microscope
      (experiment) is different compared to a large-scale facility
      accelerator or an electron microscope in at least two ways. First,
      ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments) (in the case of atom
      probe tomography) and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of
      field ion microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive and
      time-of-flight taking detector system. Hence, there is no real
      probe/beam. Second, the specimen is the lens of an atom probe
      microscope. Therefore, the reference coordinate system that is usually
      referred to in NeXus (McStas coordinate system) is modified when using
      this application definition. Specifically, the reference coordinate
      system is defined such that it represents the specimen coordinate
      system. To be consistent with accelerator and microscopy techniques we
      define that the positive z-axis points outwards from the apex of the
      specimen into the vacuum, i.e. towards the detector. The coordinate
      system remains/is a right-handed one. Clockwise rotations are
      considered positive rotations.

          Affine transformation which aligns the Cartesian right-handed
          coordinate system which defines the detector space with the specimen
          space. In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice is to discuss
          the so-called detector space image (stack). This is a stack of two-
          dimensional histograms of detected ions within a predefined
          evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of ion evaporation
          sequence IDs is grouped into chunks. For each chunk a histogram of the
          ion hit positions on the detector is computed. This leaves the
          possibility for inconsistency between the so-called detector
          coordinate system and a specimen-affixed coordinate system. The
          transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how the
          positive z-axes of either coordinate systems can be oriented.

      **control_software**: (required) :ref:`NXcollection`

        The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a single commercial
        manufacturer AMETEK (formerly Cameca). Their instruments are
        controlled via an(/a set) of integrated instrument control system(s)
        (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis). By contrast, instruments which were built by
        individual research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
        the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany), the Felfer (Oxcart,
        Erlangen, Germany), the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et
        al.), or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
        Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have individual solutions to control the
        instrument. Some of which are modularized and open, some of which
        realize also integrated control units with portions of eventually
        undisclosed source code and (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.
        Currently, there is no accepted/implemented community-specific API for
        getting finely granularized access to such control settings. This
        motivates the current design of the application definition which
        stores quantities to begin with via an NXcollection. Holding
        heterogeneous, not yet standardized, but relevant pieces of
        information is the purpose of this collection.

        A place where details about the initial shape of the specimen can be
        stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution of the
        specimen can be stored. There are currently very few techniques only
        to measure the shape evolution: One is via correlative electron
        microscopy but this usually evolves an interrupted experiment in which
        the specimen is transferred, an image taken, and a new evaporation
        sequence initiated. Another, less accurate method, though, is to
        monitor the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system (if
        available) in the instrument. Another method is to use correlated
        scanning force microscopy methods (pioneered by the imec group,
        Belgium). A continuous monitoring of the specimen in an correlative
        electron microscopy/atom probe experiment is planned to be developed
        by the Jülich group (Dunin-Borkowski/Gault).

          Ideally measured or best elaborated guess of the shank angle. This is
          a measure of the specimen taper. Define it in such a way that the base
          of the specimen is modelled as a conical frustrum so that the shank
          angle is the (shortest) angle between the specimen space z-axis and a
          vector on the lateral surface of the cone.

        This group in the hierarchy should be used to store the ion hit
        positions. Data post-processing step of analog-to-digital conversion
        of the detector signals into ion hit positions. For AMETEK LEAP
        instruments this processing takes place partly in the control unit of
        the detector partly in the software. The process is controlled by the
        acquisition/instrument control software (IVAS/APSuite/DAVis). The
        exact details are, at least in the case of AMETEK instruments, which
        applies to the majority of atom probe microscopes, kept proprietary
        and inaccessible. For instruments build by individual research groups,
        like the Oxcart instrument, individual timing data from the delay-line
        detector are openly accessible.

          as one would specify under program for the NXentry (usually IVAS or AP
          Suite), the field is required because in cases where data is post-
          processed with different software it would not be possible to

        Data post-processing step which is, like the impact position analyses,
        also usually executed in the integrated control software. This
        processing yields how many ions were detected with each pulse. In
        fact, it is possible that multiple ions evaporate and hit the same or
        different pixels of the detector on the same pulse. These data form
        the basis to analyses of the so-called (hit) multiplicity of an ion.
        Multiplicity must not be confused with how many atoms of the same
        element or isotope, respectively, a molecular ion contains. By
        contrast, this latter multiplicity is encoded in the (isotope_vector)

          The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction is
          qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers or
          research groups. Specific differences exists though in the form of
          different calibration models. For now we do not wish to resolve or
          generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection is
          to provide a container where model-specific parameters and calibration
          models can be stored if users know these for sure. For AMETEK LEAP
          systems this should be the place for storing initial calibration
          values. These values are accessible normally only by AMETEK service
          engineers and used by them for calibrating for the detector and
          instrument. Furthermore, one could then also store here the
          iteratively identified calibrations which scientists will get
          displayed in e.g. AP Suite while executing the voltage-and-bowl
