<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Characterization and session with one sample in an electron microscope.</p>
<p><strong>The idea and aim of NXem</strong>:
Electron microscopy (EM), whether it be with scanning electron microscope (SEM)
or transmission electron microscope (TEM) instruments, are versatile tools for
preparing and characterizing samples and specimens. The term specimen is considered
a synonym for sample in this application definition.
A specimen is a physical portion of material that is studied/characterized during
the microscope session, eventually in different places on the specimen surface,
illuminating either the surface layers or shining through thin specimens.
These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, an EM is an electron accelerator. Experimentalists use an EM
in sessions during which they characterize as well as prepare specimens.
This application definition describes data and metadata about processes and
characterization tasks applied to one specimen. The application definition
focuses on the usage of EM in materials research. The application definition
design makes it in principle applicable also in cryo-EM on biomaterials.</p>
<p>Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple NXentry instances.</p>
<p>There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of scientists.
These users may perform analyses for other users as a service task, especially
in large research facility settings. Oftentimes, though, and especially for
cutting-edge instruments, the scientists guide the process maybe even operating
the microscope. Oftentimes the scientists operate the instrument themselves
either on-site or remotely and can ask technicians for support.
In all cases, these people are considered users. Users might have different
roles though.</p>
<p>The rational behind a common EM schema rather than making separate application
definitions for SEM or TEM are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM
instruments:</p>
<p>Both type of instruments have electro-magnetic lenses. These may differ in
design, alignment, number, and level of corrected for aberrations.
As an obvious difference, a TEM is used mainly to measure the
transmitted electron beam. This calls for using a different lens setup and
relative placement of the specimen in the lens setup. Also TEM specimens are
substantially thinner than specimens characterized with SEM to illuminate
through the specimen. This offers capabilities for probing of
additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction which are
unavailable in SEMs.</p>
<p>Compared to SEMs, TEMs have a different relative arrangement between the
lenses and the specimen which is most obvious by the different relative
arrangement of the objective lens versus the specimen.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
measure different types of signals that originate from the same set of
radiation/specimen interactions. Consequently, detectors can also be similar
if not exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>An embracing schema instead of specific SEM or TEM schemes</strong>:
Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower
the addressed user base is which develops or uses schemes for research data
management (RDM) with EM, the more understandable it is that scientists of
either community (or sub-community) ask for method-specific schemes.</p>
<p>Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
(X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
schemes such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.</p>
<p>However, the development in the past has shown that these activities led to
a zoo of schemes and especially vocabulary in use with implementations of these
into many data and file formats. There is nothing which prevents the communities
to make these schemes open and interoperable. Open here means specifically not
that all data are compliant with/or use the schema and have to end up in the
open-source domain. There can be embargo periods first of all.</p>
<p>Open means that the metadata and associated schemata are documented in a manner
that as many details as possible are open in the sense that others can understand
what the (meta)data mean conceptually. Instead of trying of maintain a zoo
of eventually difficult to make interoperable formats and schema we would like
to advocate that the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">FAIR principles</a>
should guide all decisions how data and metadata should be stored.</p>
<p>EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different
schemes with associated representations of data and metadata in EM:
Each combination of schemes or an interoperable-made handshake between two
file formats or software packages has to be maintained by software developers.
This counts especially when data should be processed interoperably
between software packages.</p>
<p>This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
between tools have to be maintained. This can result in usage of different
terminology, which in turn results in representations and connections made
between different data representations and workflows that are not
machine-actionable.
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary">There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology.</a></p>
<p><strong>The advantage of working towards a common vocabulary and representation</strong>:
A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemes and
scientists can reuse for instance these terms, thus supporting interoperability.
Ideally, scientists specialize an application definition only for the few very
specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemes.</p>
<p>Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemes rather than
a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
academia as it enables the EM community to focus their software development
efforts on those schemes, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonizing
their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
for vendors of EM hard- and software as it improves the longevity of certain
schema; and thus can help to incentivize vendors to support the community with
implementing support for such schemes into their proprietary applications.</p>
<p>In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.</p>
<p>The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
(EM-research specific base classes) for defining schemes for EM research.
Working towards a common vocabulary is a community activity that profits from
everybody reflecting in detail whether certain terms they have used in the past
are not eventually conceptually similar if not the same as what this application
definition and its base classes provide. We are happy for receiving your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the generality versus specificity challenge</strong>:
It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for NeXus), schemes differ
already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
but it is set optional in another schema. If group(s), field(s), or
attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemes can
become inconsistent. It is noteworthy to mention that the idea of a NeXus application
definition serves as a contract between a data provider and a data consumer.
Providers can be software from specific microscopes or users with specific
analysis needs. Consumers can be again specific software tools, like vendor
software for controlling the instrument or a scientific software for doing
artificial intelligence analyses on EM data). Such changes of a schema lead
to new versions and strictly speaking an application definition can only be
really general if it does not make a single entry required, in which case however
it would also not offer much value as even empty datasets would be compliant.</p>
<p><strong>Verification of constraints and conditions</strong>:
Tools like NeXus so far do not avoid or protect against all such possible
inconsistencies; however NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which
schemes can be documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
(at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable
and interoperable FAIR data.</p>
<p>This stresses again the fundamental and necessary role of working towards
a common vocabulary and, with a longer perspective in mind, a machine-actionable
knowledge representation and verification engine. So far many conditions and
requirements are formulated in the docstrings of the respective entries of
the application definition.</p>
<p>This application definition takes a key step towards standardization of EM data.
It offers a controlled vocabulary and relation between concepts and data
relevant for research with electron microscopes. To be most efficient and
offering reusability, the application definition should be understood as a
template that one should ideally use as is. This application definition
is called NXem. NXem can be considered a base for designing more specialized
definitions (ideally prefixed with NXem) <em>method</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The use of NXem should be as follows:</strong>
Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but make
them optional or, even better, propose changes in this NXem application definition.</p>
<p>A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
It is questionable to which level such a reproducibility is possible with EM
at all considering beam damage, effects of the environment, and other not
exactly quantifiable influences.
While this points to the physical limitations there are also practical and
economical constraints on how completely EM research can be documented:
For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
may not be retrievable as vendors also have a relevant interest in finding
a compromise between being open to their user and securing their business.</p>
<p>EM experiments by design illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
procedures and system setups should be addressed first.</p>
<p>If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
between clarity but being vendor-agnostic at the same time.
Settings of apertures are an example where aperture modes are in most cases
aliases behind which there is a set of very detailed settings specific to the
software and control units used. These settings are difficult to retrieve,
often undocumented in detail by vendors. This serves users and makes EM
experiments easier understandable and conveniently executable for a broad
user base. On the flipside these subtilities limit the opportunities for
making application definitions too general.</p>
<p>Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting
this NXem application definition and base classes is that there are numerous
(technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
place to hold these nested representations; however as discussed
at the cost of generality.</p>
<p>Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
it especially challenging is when the application definition is expected to
hold all data that might be of relevance for future questions.</p>
<p>We are skeptical if there is one such representation that can fulfill all these
aims and interest, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable
by a large number of scientists in a community. However, we are also convinced
that this is not a reason to accept the status quo of having a very large set
of oftentimes strongly overlapping and redundant schemes.</p>
<p>NXem is our proposal to motivate the EM community to work towards more
standardization and discussion of what are metadata in EM. While doing
so we found that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled
vocabulary.</p>
<p>We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.
Therefore,</p>
<p><strong>This application definition has the following components at the top-level:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generic experimental details (time-zone-aware timestamp, identifiers, name);
conceptually these are session details. A session at a microscope may
involve the characterization of multiple specimens. For each specimen
an instance of an (NXentry) is created. Details of the instrument have to
be stored at least in an entry. Other entries should refer to these
metadata via links to reduce redundancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should
have an associated time-zone-aware time stamp and report of the specific
settings of the microscope at that point in time when the image was taken.
This is why instances of NXevent_data_em have an own em_lab section.
The reason is that EMs can be highly dynamic, be used to illuminate the specimen
differently or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.
What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement?
This can be the collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),
taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set of
EBSD line scans and/or surface mappings in an SEM, or the ion-beam-milling of a
specimen in preparation for e.g. an atom probe experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>NXmonitor;
instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities
pertaining to specific components of the instrument. Alternatively, NXevent_data_em
instances can be used to store time-zone-aware dates of the components, which is
relevant for documenting as exactly as practically possible settings
when images and spectra were taken.</p></li>
<li><p>NXinstrument;
conceptually this is a container to store arbitrary level of detail of the
technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which
the microscope is operated.</p></li>
<li><p>NXuser;
conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details
who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be
referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store
individualized details who executed an event of data acquisition or processing.</p></li>
<li><p>NXevent_data_em instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;
each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details
about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and
relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).</p></li>
<li><p>NXdata; at the top-level, conceptually, this is a place for documenting
available default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for
research data management systems to show a visual representation of some
aspect of the content of the EM session.
Default plottables not intended to serve every possible analysis and
visualization demand but be a preview. We made this choice because what
constitutes a useful default plot is often a matter of interpretation,
somewhat of personal taste, and community standards. In effect, default
plottables are case- and method-specific.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals and
images. Examples for possible default plottables could be arbitrarily
taken secondary, back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern,
EELS spectra, composition, or orientation mappings to name but a few.</p>
<p><strong>There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Above images, spectra, and mappings should be stored as NXdata instances,
ideally formatted in such a way that they can be displayed with
visualization software that can be specific for the file format in which
the data are stored. NeXus specifies only the data model, i.e. the terms
and their relations. These descriptions can be implemented and stored in
JSON, HDF5, XML, or HSDS, file storage, or even other formats, although
HDF5 is often used.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of
data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible
electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Images of electron counts detected in specific operation modes (bright
field, dark field in TEM, secondary/back-scattered, Kikuchi in SEM)</p></li>
<li><p>Spectra (X-ray quanta or Auger electron counts)</p></li>
<li><p>These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical processing.
It makes sense to name these data and processing tasks with a controlled
vocabulary, e.g. SE (secondary electron), BSE (back-scattered electron),
Kikuchi, X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence) etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
should be stored (in memory or on disk). To this end the schema, here makes no
specific assumptions, not even that all the fields/group of a schema instance
have to be stored at all into a single file. Instead, the schema specifies the
relations between metadata, some of the constraints and conditions on how the
data should be formatted, what the data conceptually represent, and which terms
(controlled vocabulary) is practical to store to index specific quantities.</p>
<p>In effect, the application definition is a graph which describes how
numerical data and (meta)data for EM research are related to one another.</p>

<p>Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
at the microscope.
Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.</p>
<p>It is possible that different types of programs might be used to
perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is
the case the processing should be structured with individual NXprocess
instances. If the program and/or version used for processing referred
to in an NXprocess group is different to the program and version
mentioned in this field, the NXprocess needs
to hold an own program and version.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>A container to structure a set of NXevent_data_em instances.</p>
<p>An event is a time point/time interval during which the microscope
was configured in a specific way and the microscope was used
to take a measurement. The microscope is considered stable during this
interval.</p>
<p>Each NXevent_data_em instance holds an acquisition task with the microscope.
For instance the capturing of a secondary electron, backscattered
electron, diffraction image, or spectrum.</p>
<p>An NXevent_data_em instance holds specific details about how raw data from
a detector were processed into consumable data like images, spectra,
etc. These on-the-fly data processing tasks are usually performed
by the control software, eventually realized with custom scripts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NXevent_dat_em instances can document specific values
and settings of the microscope during the snapshot/event.</p>
<p id="nxem-entry-measurement-event-data-em-group"><strong>EVENT_DATA_EM</strong>: (required) <a class="reference internal" href="NXevent_data_em.html#nxevent-data-em"><span class="std std-ref">NXevent_data_em</span></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A container holding a specific result of the measurement and
eventually metadata how that result was obtained numerically.</p>
<p>NXevent_em instances can hold several specific
NXimage_em or NXspectrum_em instances taken and considered as
one event, i.e. a point in time when the microscope had the
settings specified either in NXinstrument or in this NXevent_data_em
instance.</p>
<p>The application definition is designed without an explicit need
an NXevent_data_em instance that contains an NXimage_em or
NXspectra_em instance. An NXevent_data_em can be used to document a
specific state of the microscope at a time without having it placed
into the NXinstrument group.</p>
<p>In other words the NXinstrument group details primarily the more
static settings and components of the microscope as they are found
by the operator during the session. The NXevent_data_em samples
the dynamics.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to store data in NXebeam, NXibeam instances
of NXevent_data_em but in this case it is assumed that the settings
were constant over the entire course of microscope session
and thus all relevant metadata inside the NXinstrument groups
are sufficient to understand the session.</p>
<p>So far there is no vendor-overarching standard according to which
electron microscope data are documented and stored. Therefore, it is
still a frequently the case that vendor-specific files have many fields
that cannot be safely mapped. Therefore, users are always adviced to
keep the vendor files. Working however with these vendor files inside
specific software, like materials databases, demands for parsers which
extract pieces of information from the vendor representation (numerical
data and metadata) and map them on a schema with which the database
and its associated software tools can work with.</p>
<p>Currently, one would loose immediately track of e.g. provenance and
the origin of certain data in NXevent_data_em instances unless really
all data are safely and reliably copied over into an instance of the
schema. Currently, though, this is sadly effectively prevented in many
cases as vendors indeed implemented often sophisticated provenance
and commercial software state tracking tools but these are not yet
documented dynamically, coveringly enough in our opinion so that it is
safe to assume all vendor field names are known, logically understood,
interpretable, and thus mappable on a common schema using a controlled
common vocabulary.</p>
<p>Therefore we encourage user for now to store for each image_set_em
or spectra_set_em instance to supply the so-called source of the data.
This can for instance be the name and hashvalue of the original
file which was acquired during the microscope session and from which then
certain like numerical data and metadata were copied into an instance
of this schema for the purpose of working with the data in e.g. tools
offered by the materials database.</p>
<p>During work on implementing file format/metadata parsers and developing
this application definition we realized that several software tools
currently do not consistently track time-zone-aware timestamps of
events associated with the data, processing, and during the microscope
session. This is in partly a consequence of vendor which store
detailed time data in different formats. We would like to encourage the
community and especially the vendors to work towards a standardization,
or at least a open documentation of the way how time-zone-aware time
data are collected and stored how and where during a microscope session
and how they end up in files and databases with which users interact.
This would enable to supplement instances of this schema with specific
time data and assure that these time data can be used to reliably
contextualize individual datasets and processing steps in materials
information systems.</p>
<p>For the reason that these measures have not yet been fully taken,
the start_time and end_time is a recommended option.
The idea behind these time-zone-aware dates is to identify when
the data were collected at the microscope but NOT when they were
transcoded by some software tool(s) while storing the data in an
instance of this schema.</p>
