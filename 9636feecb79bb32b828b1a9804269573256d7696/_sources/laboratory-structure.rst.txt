.. _LaboratorySteps:

Virtually all experiments require a preparation of the sample. As most techniques
are surface-sensitive or probe exclusively the surface, the use of careful preparation
techniques is the key to successful experiments. Unfortunately, the quality of
such processes is often difficult to reproduce. Nevertheless, documenting how samples
are prepared is relevant. The classes here provide minimal examples how descriptions
of the sample preparation steps can be interfaced to NeXus.
Currently, we consider these drafts to work towards harmonization with the
specific examples developed by the team of area A of FAIRmat.
