**Structure**:

  .. _/NXapm/ENTRY-group:

  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY@version-attribute:

    .. index:: version (group attribute)

    **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the file
      that specifies the application definition.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition-field:

    .. index:: definition (field)

    **definition**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      NeXus NXDL schema to which this file conforms.

      Obligatory value: ``NXapm``

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_identifier-field:

    .. index:: experiment_identifier (field)

    **experiment_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier
      for referring to this experiment.

      The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
      or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
      experiments to e.g. proposals.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_description-field:

    .. index:: experiment_description (field)

    **experiment_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Free-text description about the experiment.

      Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
      respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
      of the application definition behind instead of filling in these
      details into the experiment_description free-text description field.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the microscope session started.
      If the application demands that time codes in this section of the
      application definition should only be used for specifying when the
      experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant
      - this start_time field should be used.

      Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
      both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping
      and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that
      even with having both dates specified, it may not be possible
      to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data
      were collected.

      More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be
      collected to compute this event chain during the experiment.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included
      when the microscope session ended.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program-field:

    .. index:: program (field)

    **program**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used
      to create the original results file of the atom probe experiment.
      This file and program should not be confused with downstream
      processing operations and file format conversion tasks.

      Atom probe microscopy experiments are except for still very much cases
      controlled via commercial software. Such software is designed as an
      integrated acquisition and instrument control software.

      For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the
      least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored
      in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary and the
      specifications of which are not publicly documented.

      Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected
      to the instrument control software and synced with the experiment
      while signal is being detected. In effect, RHIT and HITS files
      store the (rawest) experiment data in a closed manner that is
      practically useless for users unless they have access to the
      commercial software.

      To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy (APM) with LEAP instruments
      delivers a dataset with which users can study reconstructed atomic
      position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing
      analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is
      necessary that for an application definition to be useful, details about
      the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its
      processing steps have to be stored.

      With this a user can create derived quantities like ion hit positions
      (on the detector) and calibrated time-of-flight data. These derived
      quantities are also needed to obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state
      ratios, and finally the tomographic reconstruction of the ion positions.

      In most cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      via so-called ranging. Ranging defines rules for mapping time-of-flight
      and mass-to-charge-state ratio values on ion species. This is post-processing
      even though in practice it is performed sometimes already (as preview)
      already while data are still being collected.

      The ion types decode molecular identities which can very often be
      mapped to elemental identities, and also to resolve isotopes.
      All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software.

      Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with
      (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking
      not a single program used throughout an atom probe analysis not even
      for the early stage data acquisition and processing stages to obtain
      a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset.

      Therefore, this application definition documents not only the measurement
      but also the key post-processing steps which transform the proprietary
      data into a tomographic reconstruction with ranging definitions.

      Future guidance by the vendors could improve this description to cover
      a substantial larger number of eventually metadata that so far
      are not publicly documented and accessible in an open-source manner.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of an
        ever persistent resource where the source code of the program and
        build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured
        in such a manner that the result file is ideally recreatable
        yielding the same results.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/run_number-field:

    .. index:: run_number (field)

    **run_number**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Neither the specimen_name nor the experiment_identifier but the identifier
      through which the experiment is referred to in the control software.
      For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/APSuite
      run_number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or
      Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments at GPM in Rouen, use the
      identifier which is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number.

      As a destructive microscopy technique, a run can be performed only once.
      It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart data acquisition
      while still using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run
      needs to be distinguished with different run numbers.
      We follow this habit of most atom probe groups.

      This application definition does currently not allow to store the
      entire set of such interrupted runs to be stored and covered. However,
      this is not because of a technical limitation within NeXus but
      because we have not seen a covering use case based on which we could
      have implemented and conceptualized this. Atom probers are invited to
      contact the respective people in the FAIRmat team to fix this.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/operation_mode-field:

    .. index:: operation_mode (field)

    **operation_mode**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      What type of atom probe microscopy experiment is performed.
      This field is primarily meant to inform materials database systems
      to qualitatively filter experiments:

      * apt are experiments where the analysis_chamber has no imaging gas.  
        experiment with LEAP instruments are typically performed as apt.  
      * fim are experiments where the analysis_chamber has an imaging gas,  
        which should be specified with the atmosphere in the analysis_chamber group.  
      * apt_fim should be used for combinations of the two imaging modes.  
      * other should be used in combination with the user specifying details in the  
        experiment_documentation field.

      Any of these values: ``apt`` | ``fim`` | ``apt_fim`` | ``other``

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_documentation-group:

    **experiment_documentation**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote`

      Binary container for a file or a compressed collection of files which
      can be used to add further descriptions and details to the experiment.
      The container can hold a compressed archive.

      Required for operation_mode apt_fim or other to give further details.
      Users should not abuse this field to provide free-text information.
      Instead, these pieces of information should be mapped to
      respective groups and sections.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/thumbnail-group:

    **thumbnail**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote`

      A small image that is representative of the entry; this can be an
      image taken from the dataset like a thumbnail of a spectrum.
      A 640 x 480 pixel jpeg image is recommended. 
      Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but not required
      as the main purpose of the thumbnail is to provide e.g. thumbnail
      images for displaying them in data repositories.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/thumbnail@type-attribute:

      .. index:: type (group attribute)

      **@type**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    **USER**: (required) :ref:`NXuser`

      Contact information and eventually details of at least one person
      involved in the taking of the microscope session. This can be the
      principle investigator who performed this experiment.

      **email**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Email address of the user at the point in time when the experiment
        was performed. Writing the most permanently used email is recommended.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/USER/orcid-field:

      .. index:: orcid (field)

      **orcid**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Globally unique identifier of the user as offered by services
        like ORCID or ResearcherID. If this field is field the specific 
        service should also be written in orcid_platform

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/USER/orcid_platform-field:

      .. index:: orcid_platform (field)

      **orcid_platform**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Name of the OrcID or ResearcherID where the account
        under orcid is registered.

      **role**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Which role does the user have in the place and at the point 
        in time when the experiment was performed? Technician operating
        the microscope. Student, postdoc, principle investigator, guest

        under social_media_name is registered.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen-group:

    **specimen**: (required) :ref:`NXsample`


      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/name-field:

      .. index:: name (field)

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Descriptive name or ideally (globally) unique persistent identifier.
        The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially the
        predecessor/origin from where the specimen was cut.
        In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from
        samples or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple
        specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to resolve
        which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken.

        The user is advised to store the details how specimens were
        cut/prepared from samples in the sample history. This field must
        not be used for an alias of the specimen. Instead, use short_title.

        In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
        the name has to be the specific one, whose results are stored
        by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
        the characterization of a single specimen in a single continuous run.

        Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
        sample history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/sample_history-field:

      .. index:: sample_history (field)

      **sample_history**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally, a reference to the location of or a (globally) unique
        persistent identifier of e.g. another file which should document
        ideally as many details as possible of the material, its
        microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/
        preparation history.

        In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not
        available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a
        sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider
        as being the key steps and relevant information about the specimen,
        its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing
        state and details of the preparation.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/preparation_date-field:

      .. index:: preparation_date (field)

      **preparation_date**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
        when the specimen was prepared.

        Ideally, report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time
        the measured specimen surface was actively prepared. Usually this
        should be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample is imagined
        handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope
        the session starts.

        Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is
        especially required for environmentally sensitive material such as
        hydrogen charged specimens or experiments including tracers with a
        short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
        better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/short_title-field:

      .. index:: short_title (field)

      **short_title**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Possibility to give an abbreviation of the specimen name field.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/atom_types-field:

      .. index:: atom_types (field)

      **atom_types**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table
        that are contained in the sample. 
        If the sample substance has multiple components, all 
        elements from each component must be included in `atom_types`.

        The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an
        opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret
        these from the sample history or from other data sources.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/description-field:

      .. index:: description (field)

      **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Discouraged free-text field in case properly designed records
        for the sample_history are not available.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (optional) :ref:`NXdata`

      Hard link to a location in the hierarchy of the NeXus file
      where the data for default plotting are stored.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET-group:

    **COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET**: (recommended) :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`

      Container to hold different coordinate systems conventions.

      For the specific idea and conventions to use with the
      NXcoordinate_system_set inspect the description of the
      NXcoordinate_system_set base class. Specific details for application
      in atom probe microscopy follow.

      In this research field scientists distinguish usually several
      Euclidean coordinate systems (CS):

      * The laboratory space;  
        a CS specifying the room where the instrument is located in or  
        a physical landmark on the instrument, e.g. the direction of the  
        transfer rod where positive is the direction how the rod  
        has to be pushed during loading a specimen into the instrument.  
      * The specimen space;  
        a CS affixed to either the base or the initial apex of the specimen,  
        whose z axis points towards the detector.  
      * The detector space;  
        a CS affixed to the detector plane whose xy plane is usually in the  
        detector and whose z axis points towards the specimen.  
        This is a distorted space with respect to the reconstructed ion  
        positions.  
      * The reconstruction space;  
        a CS in which the reconstructed ion positions are defined.  
        The orientation depends on the analysis software used.  
      * Eventually further coordinate systems attached to the  
        flight path of individual ions might be defined.

      Coordinate systems should be right-handed ones.
      Clockwise rotations should be considered positive rotations.

      In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice for the detector
      space (CS) is discussed with the so-called detector space image
      (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions
      within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of
      ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks.

      For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector
      is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between
      the so-called detector space and the e.g. specimen space.

      The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how
      the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems is oriented.
      Consult the work of A. J. Breen and B. Gault and team
      for further details.

    **atom_probe**: (required) :ref:`NXinstrument`

      Metadata and numerical data of the atom probe and the lab in which it 
      stands.

      An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-
      scale facility or electron accelerator experiments in at least two ways:

      * First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments)  
        (in the case of atom probe tomography)  
        and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion  
        microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive  
        and time-of-flight taking detector system.  
        Hence, there is no real probe/beam.  
      * Second, the specimen is the lens of the microscope.

      .. index:: instrument_name (field)

      **instrument_name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Given name of the atom probe at the hosting institution. This is an
        alias. Examples could be LEAP5000, Raptor, Oxcart, one atom at a time,
        etc.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/location-field:

      .. index:: location (field)

      **location**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Location of the lab or place where the instrument is installed.
        Using GEOREF is preferred.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/flight_path_length-field:

      .. index:: flight_path_length (field)

      **flight_path_length**: (required) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

        The space inside the atom probe along which ions pass nominally
        when they leave the specimen and travel to the detector.

        THIS DOCSTRING NEEDS CLARIFICATION.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/field_of_view-field:

      .. index:: field_of_view (field)

      **field_of_view**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

        The nominal diameter of the specimen ROI which is measured in the
        experiment. It is important to mention that the physical specimen

          and `C. Fletcher <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abaaa6>`_.  
        * Another method, which is less accurate though, is to monitor  
          the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system  
          (if available) in the instrument.  
        * Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy  
          methods like reported in `C. Fleischmann <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2018.08.010>`_.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe/control_software-group:

      **control_software**: (required) :ref:`NXcollection`

        The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a
        single commercial manufacturer `AMETEK (formerly Cameca) <https://www.atomprobe.com>`_.
        Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated
        instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis).

        By contrast, instruments which were built by individual
        research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France),
        the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany),
        the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany),
        the Northwestern (D. Isheim, Seidman group et al.),
        or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary,
        Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have other solutions
        to control the instrument.

        Some of which are modularized and open,
        some of which realize also integrated control units with
        portions of eventually undisclosed source code and
        (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs.

        Currently, there is no accepted/implemented
        community-specific API for getting finely granularized
        access to such control settings.

        These considerations motivated the design of the NXapm
        application definition in that it stores quantities in NXcollection.

        steps related to analog-to-digital conversion of detector signals
        into ion hit positions. For AMETEK LEAP instruments this processing
        takes place partly in the control unit of the detector partly
        in the software. The process is controlled by the acquisition/
        instrument control software (IVAS/APSuite/DAVis).
        The exact details are not documented by AMETEK in an open manner.
        For instruments built by individual research groups,

      **hit_multiplicity**: (recommended) :ref:`NXprocess`

        Data post-processing step which is, like the impact position analyses,
        usually executed in the integrated control software. This processing
        yields how many ions were detected with each pulse.

        It is possible that multiple ions evaporate and hit the same or
        different pixels of the detector on the same pulse.
        These data form the basis to analyses of the so-called
        (hit) multiplicity of an ion.

        Multiplicity must not be confused with how many atoms 
        f the same element or isotope, respectively, a molecular
        ion contains (which is instead encoded with the
        isotope_vector field of each NXion instance).

        ion filtering is a data post-processing step with which users
        identify which of the detected ions should be included
        in the voltage-and-bowl correction.
        This post-processing is usually performed via GUI interaction

          The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction is
          qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers
          or research groups.

          Specific differences exists though in the form of different
          calibration models. For now we do not wish to resolve or
          generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection
          is to provide a container where model-specific parameters
          and calibration models can be stored if users know these
          for sure.

          For AMETEK LEAP instruments this should be the place for
          storing initial calibration values. These values are
          accessible normally only by AMETEK service engineers.
          They use these for calibrating the detector and instrument.

          Users can also use this NXcollection for storing the
          iteratively identified calibrations which scientists
          will see displayed in e.g. APSuite while they execute
          the voltage-and-bowl correction as a part of the
