    .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation-group:

    **volume_volume_spatial_correlation**: (required) :ref:`NXprocess`

      Tracking volume_volume_spatial_correlation is the process of building logical
      relations between volumetric features based on meshes, their proximity and
      eventual intersections. Volumetric overlap and proximity of volumetric
      features is identified for members of sets of features to members of
      other sets of volumetric features.
      Specifically, for each time step k pairs of sets are compared:
      Members of a so-called current_set to members of a so-called next_set.
      Members can be different types of volumetric features.
      In the analysis of M. Kuehbach et al. specifically features can be
      so-called objects (closed non-degnerated polyhedra representing watertight
      parts of an e.g. iso-surface) and/or proxies. Proxies are computed
      doppelganger/replacement meshes for parts of an iso-surface which initially
      were not resulting in watertight meshes because objects at the edge
      of the dataset or incompletely measured or truncated objects.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/intersection_detection_method-field:

      .. index:: intersection_detection_method (field)

      **intersection_detection_method**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Specifies the method whereby to decide if two objects intersect volumetrically.
        For reasons which are detailed in the supplementary material of
        `M. Kühbach et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13510>`_, the tool by
        default assumes that two objects intersect if they share at least one
        ion with the same evaporation ID (shared_ion).
        Alternatively, with specifying tetrahedra_intersections,
        the tool can perform an intersection analysis which attempts to 
        tetrahedralize first each polyhedron. If successful, the tool then checks
        for at least one pair of intersecting tetrahedra to identify if two objects
        intersect or not.

        However, we found that these geometrical analyses can result in corner
        cases which the currently used library (TetGen) was not unable to
        tetrahedralize successfully. These cases were virtually always
        associated with complicated non-convex polyhedra which had portions
        of the mesh that were connected by almost point like tubes of triangles.
        Finding more robust methods for computing intersections between
        not necessarily convex polyhedra might improve the situation in the future.

        Obligatory value: ``shared_ion``

      .. index:: analyze_intersection (field)

      **analyze_intersection**: (required) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>`

        Specifies if the tool evaluates if for each pair the two objects
        (and proxies if used) intersect volumetrically.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/analyze_proximity-field:

      .. index:: analyze_proximity (field)

      **analyze_proximity**: (required) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>`

        Specifies if the tool evaluates if for each pair the two objects
        (and proxies if used) lie closer to one another than the
        threshold_proximity.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/analyze_coprecipitation-field:

      .. index:: analyze_coprecipitation (field)

      **analyze_coprecipitation**: (required) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>`

        Specifies if the tool evaluates, ones all tracking tasks were
        successfully completed, how intersecting or proximity related
        objects build sub-graphs. This is the feature which enabled
        M. Kühbach et al. 2022 the high-throughput analyses of how many
        objects are coprecipitates in the sense that they are single,
        duplet, triplet, or high-order. For these analyses to work
        has_object_volume needs to be activated.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/threshold_proximity-field:

      .. index:: threshold_proximity (field)

      **threshold_proximity**: (required) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

        both objects are still considered within proximity.

      .. index:: has_current_to_next_links (field)

      **has_current_to_next_links**: (required) :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>`

        Specifies if the tool stores the so-called forward relations between
        nodes representing members of the current_set to nodes representing
        members of the next_set.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/has_next_to_current_links-field:

      .. index:: has_next_to_current_links (field)

        Specifies if the tool stores the so-called backward relations between
        nodes representing members of the next_set to nodes representing
        members of the current_set.

      .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/current_set-group:

      **current_set**: (required) :ref:`NXprocess`

        Current set stores a set of members, meshes of volumetric features,
        which will be checked for proximity and/or volumetric intersection,
        to members of the current_set.
        The meshes were generated as a result of some other meshing process.

        .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/current_set/set_identifier-field:

        .. index:: set_identifier (field)

        **set_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

          This identifier can be used to label the current set. The label
          effectively represents (can be interpreted as) the time/iteration
          step when the current set was taken. As it is detailed in M. Kühbach
          et al. 2022, this identifier takes the role of the time variable k.

        .. _/NXapm_paraprobe_config_intersector/ENTRY/volume_volume_spatial_correlation/current_set/number_of_feature_types-field:

        .. index:: number_of_feature_types (field)

        **number_of_feature_types**: (required) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

          The total number of distinguished feature sets FEATURE.
          It is assumed that the members within all these FEATURE sets
          are representing a set together. As an example this set might represent
          all volumetric_features. However, users might have formed
          a subset of this set where individuals were regrouped.
          For paraprobe-nanochem this is the case for objects and proxies.
          Specifically, objects are distinguished further into those far
          from and those close to the edge of the dataset.
          Similarly, proxies are distinguished further into those far
          from and those close to the edge of the dataset.
          So while these four sub-sets contain different so-called types of
          features key is that they were all generated for one set, here the
          current_set.

          effectively represents (can be interpreted as) the time/iteration
          step when the current set was taken. As it is detailed in M. Kühbach
