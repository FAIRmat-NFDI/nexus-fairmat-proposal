**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Base class to describe details about interfaces observed in microstructures.

  Classically, interfaces are two-dimensional crystal defects whose relevance is
  that they are agents which trigger crystal growth and discontinuities of the
  crystal at which defects can accumulate and solutes segregate with fundamental
  effect on the properties of materials. Conceptually, interfaces are a
  continuum-scale description of how atoms arrange spatio-temporally. Interfaces
  manifests as persistent defects. When inspected in more detail though they show
  atom dynamics, coarse-grainable into again interactions between line-type
  crystal defects (disconnections) through which interfaces are dynamic and can
  interact with other defects. Owing to this complexity very different
  descriptions are used depending on which length-, time-scale,
  and research question people address.

  This is manifested in the large amount of literature on the topic:

  * A. P. Sutton et al. ISBN-13 978-0198500612  
  * G. Gottstein et al. ISBN-13 978-1-4200-5436-1  
  * K. Chen et al. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920504117

  Interfaces, specifically grain and phase boundaries, are representatives of
  two-dimensional microstructural features. It would be rude to claim that a single
  base class can encompass the entire complexity that this effective
  coarse-graining of atomic spatio-temporal configurations has. In the end,
  interfaces are a model, an effort to simplicify the description in the hope
  to arrive at physical models which do not need to take into account the static
  and dynamic details of every atom.

  However, it is also a fact that not every description, research question, and 
  thus use cases that one could think of storing as data and metadata for
  interfaces, is equally relevant and useful for an ensemble of research studies.

  Thus, for the design of concrete schemes for a structured storage of data on
  interfaces are measured or characterized, one has to prioritize which
  descriptors and aspects about interfaces are likely relevant for a large
  number of users of the research infrastructure. Consequently, it is possible
  to narrow down the scope of this base class.

  It is noteworthy to mention that this applies not only to schemes build
  with NeXus, but points to the problem of creating a golden-bullet schema
  that could handle all possible subtleties of interfaces.

  For now we have to accept that there is not yet an ontology of e.g. the
  above-mentioned understanding of what interfaces are.

  Pragmatically we thus make the following assumptions:

  * This base class is essentially a template how specific, often referred to  
    quantities, for two-dimensional crystal defects can be stored.  
  * Coarse-graining point-like features into a curve or surfaces is an  
    ill-posed problem. In practice, it has to be accounted for that interfaces  
    have a finite extent, they are delineated by triple lines and quadruple  
    junctions. Interfaces are thus connected into a three-dimensional network  
    of defects. Interfaces can interact or intersect with other defects  
    (partially or completely, as it is the case for disconnections).

  There are the following general approaches of studying/characterizing:

  * Non-atomically resolved measurements of 2D or 3D sections.  
    Examples are optical, electron, X-ray, or atom probe microscopy.  
  * Under specific conditions using electron microscopy, electron tomography  
    (provided numerical post-processing is applied) as well as with atom probe  
    microscopy these measurement can resolve structural motifs of or in the  
    interface plane.  
  * Atomic-scale-resolved simulations. In this case the most frequently  
    performed tasks are again post-processing snapshots with grain identification  
    or graph-based techniques to identify which atoms belong to the regions  
    with local changes or breakdown of the long-range crystal symmetry.  
  * Analytical approaches whereby grain boundaries are resolved at the continuum  
    scale, as surface defects containing other elementary defects (for instance)  
    in models of disconnection motion), using eventual statistical approaches,  
    or again atomically resolved treatments.

  From this we can conclude that an NXms_interface_set can primarily be
  useful as a wrapper class in which specific details about interfaces
  can be stored in an arbitrarily nested manner.
