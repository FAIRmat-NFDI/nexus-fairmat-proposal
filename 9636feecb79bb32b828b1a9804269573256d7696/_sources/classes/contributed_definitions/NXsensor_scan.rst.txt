      .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT-group:

      **ENVIRONMENT**: (required) :ref:`NXenvironment`

        Describes an environment setup for the experiment.

        All the setting values of the independently scanned controllers are listed under corresponding
        NXsensor groups. Similarly, seperate NXsensor groups are used to store the readings from each
        measurement sensor.

        For example, in a temperature-dependent IV measurement, the temperature and voltage must be 
        present as independently scanned controllers and the current sensor must also be present with
        its readings.

        .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/independent_controllers-field:

        .. index:: independent_controllers (field)

        **independent_controllers**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

          A list of names of NXsensor groups used as independently scanned controllers.

        .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/measurement_sensors-field:

        .. index:: measurement_sensors (field)

        **measurement_sensors**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

          A list of names of NXsensor groups used as measurement sensors.

        .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR-group:

        **SENSOR**: (required) :ref:`NXsensor`


          .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/value-field:

          .. index:: value (field)

          **value**: (required) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [N_scanpoints]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

            For each point in the scan space, either the nominal setpoint of an independently scanned controller
            or a representative average value of a measurement sensor is registered.

            The length of each sensor's data value array stored in this group should be equal to the number of scan points
            probed in this scan. For every scan point [N], the corresponding sensor value can be picked from index [N].
            This allows the scan to be made in any order as the user describes above in the experiment. We get matching
            values simply using the index of the scan point.

          .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/value_timestamp-field:

          .. index:: value_timestamp (field)

          **value_timestamp**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

            Timestamp for when the values provided in the value field were registered.

            Individual readings can be stored with their timestamps under value_log. This is to timestamp
            the nominal setpoint or average reading values listed above in the value field.

          .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/run_control-field:

          .. index:: run_control (field)

          **run_control**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`


            .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/run_control@description-attribute:

            .. index:: description (field attribute)

            **@description**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

              Free-text describing the data acquisition control: an internal
              sweep using the built-in functionality of the controller device,
              or a set/wait/read/repeat mechanism.

          .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/calibration_time-field:

          .. index:: calibration_time (field)

          **calibration_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

            ISO8601 datum when calibration was last performed
            before this measurement. UTC offset should be specified.

          .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/SENSOR/DATA-group:

          **DATA**: (recommended) :ref:`NXdata`

            Plot of measured signal as a function of the timestamp of when they have been acquired is also possible.

        .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/ENVIRONMENT/PID-group:

        **PID**: (required) :ref:`NXpid`


    .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/SAMPLE-group:

    **SAMPLE**: (required) :ref:`NXsample`


      .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/SAMPLE/name-field:

      .. index:: name (field)

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`


    .. _/NXsensor_scan/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (required) :ref:`NXdata`

      A scan specific representation of the measured signals as a function of the independently controlled environment settings.
      Plot of every measured signal as a function of the timestamp of when they have been acquired is also possible.
