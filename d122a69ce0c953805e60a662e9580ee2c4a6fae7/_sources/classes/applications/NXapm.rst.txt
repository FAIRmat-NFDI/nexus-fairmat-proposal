**Structure**:

  .. _/NXapm/ENTRY-group:

  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`


    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition-field:

    .. index:: definition (field)

    **definition**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Official NeXus NXDL schema to which this entry conforms.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/definition@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Version specifier which enables documentation of modifications to the schema.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_identifier-field:

    .. index:: experiment_identifier (field)

    **experiment_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Ideally, a (globally persistent) unique identifier for referring to this experiment. The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory, or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link experiments to e.g. proposals.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/experiment_description-field:

    .. index:: experiment_description (field)

    **experiment_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Possibility for leaving a free-text description about the experiment. Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields of this application definition rather than writing these details in prose into this field.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included when the experiment started. If the application demands that time codes in this section of the application definition should only be used for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant - this start time field should be used. Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with having both time instances specified it may not be advisable to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data were acquired. More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be collected.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601-formatted time code with local time zone offset to UTC included when the experiment ended.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program_name-field:

    .. index:: program_name (field)

    **program_name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program that was used to acquire/measure the dataset. Atom probe microscopy experiments are nowadays still in most cases controlled via commercial software. These are often designed as integrated acquisition and instrument control software. For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary. Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected to the control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software other than of AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite). In effect, RHIT and HITS store the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless for users unless they have access to the commercial software. To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy delivers a dataset with which one can study reconstructed atomic position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is necessary that for an application definition to be useful details about the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its processing steps have to be stored to arrive at derived quantities like ion hit positions (on the detector), calibrated time-of-flight data, and from these results obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state ratios, and finally the tomographically reconstructed atomic positions. In many cases cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed via so-called ranging. Ranging defines a set of rules how to map between time-of-flight and mass-to-charge data on ion types with which in turn one can decode elemental identities and resolve isotopes. All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software. Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking not a single program used in atom probe to arrive at a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset. Hence, the reason to design the application definition with the acquisition and key post-processing steps.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/program_name@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally program version plus build number, or commit hash or description of ever persistent resources where the source code of the program and build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured ideally in such a manner that the result file is numerically recreatable in the same deterministic manner.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/run_number-field:

    .. index:: run_number (field)

    **run_number**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Not the specimen name or the experiment identifier but the identifier through which the experiment is referred to in the control software. For LEAP instruments it is recommended to use the IVAS/AP Suite run number. For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments in Rouen, use the identifier that is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number. As a destructive microscopy method, a run can be performed only once. It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart, still all using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run needs to be distinguished with different run numbers. # This is how most atom probe groups handle it across the globe.

    **thumbnail**: (recommended) :ref:`NXnote`

      A small image that is representative of the entry. For reconstructed datasets it is recommended to display the reconstruction as a 640x480 pixel jpeg image. Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but not required as the main purpose of the thumbnail is to provide e.g. thumbnail images for displaying them in data repositories.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/thumbnail@type-attribute:

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Descriptive name or identifier with which to distinguish the specimen from all others and especially the parts from where it was cut. In cases where the specimen was e.g. site-specifically cut from samples or in cases of an instrument session during which multiple specimens are loaded, the name has to be descriptive enough to resolve which specimen on e.g. the microtip array was taken. The user is advised to store the details how specimens were cut/prepared from samples in the sample history.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/sample_history-field:

      .. index:: sample_history (field)

      **sample_history**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally, a reference to the location of or a (globally persistent) unique identifier of e.g. another file which should document ideally as many details as possible of the material, its microstructure, and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/preparation history. In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not available, use this field as a free-text description to specify a sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider being the key steps and relevant information about the specimen, its material, microstructure, thermo-chemo-mechanical processing state and details of the preparation.

      .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/specimen/preparation_date-field:

      .. index:: preparation_date (field)

      **preparation_date**: (recommended) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

        Use Hill's system for listing elements of the periodic table which are inside or attached to the surface of the specimen and thus considered relevant from a scientific point. The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an opportunity to parse the relevant elements without having to interpret these from the sample history.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (required) :ref:`NXdata`

      Hard link to a location/locations in the hierarchy of the NeXus file where the data for default plotting are stored.

    .. _/NXapm/ENTRY/atom_probe-group:

    **atom_probe**: (required) :ref:`NXinstrument`

      Metadata and numerical data of not only the microscope but also the lab in which this microscope is located. An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-scale facility accelerator or an electron microscope in at least two ways. First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments) (in the case of atom probe tomography) and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive and time-of-flight taking detector system. Hence, there is no real probe/beam. Second, the specimen is the lens of an atom probe microscope. Therefore, the reference coordinate system that is usually referred to in NeXus (McStas coordinate system) is modified when using this application definition. Specifically, the reference coordinate system is defined such that it represents the specimen coordinate system. To be consistent with accelerator and microscopy techniques we define that the positive z-axis points outwards from the apex of the specimen into the vacuum, i.e. towards the detector. The coordinate system remains/is a right-handed one. Clockwise rotations are considered positive rotations.

      **instrument_manufacturer**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Manufacturer of the entire instrument (e.g. AMETEK/Cameca) to enable e.g. queries in materials database systems for instrument manufacturers. Usually more technical details are needed though to specify the instrument, these should be written into instrument_model and instrument_capabilities.

        **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations`

          Affine transformation which aligns the Cartesian right-handed coordinate system which defines the detector space with the specimen space. In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice is to discuss the so-called detector space image (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks. For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between the so-called detector coordinate system and a specimen-affixed coordinate system. The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems can be oriented.

      **control_software**: (required) :ref:`NXcollection`

        The majority of atom probe microscopes come from a single commercial manufacturer AMETEK (formerly Cameca). Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/DAVis). By contrast, instruments which were built by individual research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France), the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany), the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany), or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary, Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have individual solutions to control the instrument. Some of which are modularized and open, some of which realize also integrated control units with portions of eventually undisclosed source code and (so far) lacking (support of)/open APIs. Currently, the is no community-specific API for getting finely granularized access to such control settings. This motivates the current design of the application definition via an NXcollection. Holding heterogeneous, not yet standardized but relevant pieces of information is the purpose of this collection.

        A place where details about the initial shape of the specimen can be stored. Ideally, here also data about the shape evolution of the specimen can be stored. There are currently few techniques to measure the shape evolution: One is via correlative electron microscopy but this usually evolves an interrupted experiment in which the specimen is transferred, an image taken, and a new evaporation sequence initiated. Another, less accurate method, though, is to monitor the specimen evolution via the in-built camera system (if available) in the instrument. Another method is to use correlated scanning force microscopy methods (pioneered by the imec group, Belgium). A continuous monitoring of the specimen in an correlative electron microscopy/atom probe experiment is planned to be developed by the Jülich group.

        This group in the hierarchy should be used to store the ion hit positions. Data post-processing step of analog-to-digital conversion of the detector signals into ion hit positions. For AMETEK LEAP instruments this processing takes place partly in the control unit of the detector and is instructed and monitored/supervised by the acquisition/instrument control software (IVAS/APSuite/DAVis). The exact details are, at least in the case of AMETEK instruments (the large majority of installations worldwide) kept proprietary and inaccessible. For instruments like Oxcart individual timing data from the delay-line detector are open and thus community software can be used to decode these data into ion impact positions.

          The key idea and algorithm of the voltage-and-bowl correction is qualitatively similar for instruments of different manufacturers or research groups but different specific calibration models exists. In the first draft of the application definition we do not wish to resolve or generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection is to provide a container where model specific parameters and calibration models can be stored if users know these for sure. For AMETEK LEAP systems this should be the place for storing initial calibration values. These values are accessible normally only by AMETEK service engineers and used by them for calibrating for the detector and instrument. Furthermore, one could then also store here the iteratively identified calibrations which scientists will get displayed in e.g. AP Suite while executing the voltage-and-bowl correction as part of the reconstruction pipeline.
